## 📘 Project Overview
This project explores global COVID-19 vaccination data to uncover regional disparities, manufacturer distribution patterns, and factors that influenced rollout success. The first phase focuses on data wrangling, validation, and exploratory analysis to prepare a clean and reliable foundation. In later phases, the team will apply data science techniques such as time series forecasting, clustering, and correlation modeling to identify vaccination trends, forecast future coverage, and evaluate relationships between vaccine types and rollout efficiency. The ultimate goal is to translate complex data into actionable insights that support public health decision making.
